# Reconciliation RPA
An RPA to improve the reconciliation process of ensuring that the balances in two accounts tally

## What is the Reconciliation Process?
 1. It is a common process that is carried out in accounting firms/by accountants <br>
 2. Process of ensuring that the balances of two accounts tally <br>
    - This is to ensure that _**Money leaving the account = Money actually spent**_
    - E.g Comparing the full invoice report with each and every monthly invoice report
 
## The Reconciliation Process (Before RPA)
The accountant will have to manually carry out a few tasks <br>
  <li> Open up all the individual monthly invoice reports from each vendor
  <li>  Tally up the total in each of those monthly invoice reports
  <li>  Do the subtraction between the total sum stated for each month in the Full Invoice Report and the total that was tallied up in each monthly invoice report

## Problems with the Reconciliation Process
1. It is an inefficient process
   - Regquires alot of manual data entry and manipulations
   - Process is extremely time consuming
    
2. High chance of error
   - The task is very mundane and the fatigue it creates  result in the accountant making errors whilst carrying out calculations
    
## Improving the process by introducing RPA
<li> By automating the process, many of these above problems can be eliminated
<li> Man hours are freed up and employees can utilise their time more efficiently
<li> Accuracy of reports greatly increased - robots do not make errors when carrying out calculations
